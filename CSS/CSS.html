	<p style="color:red;background-color: blue;font-size: 25px;">Another place you can write CSS is inside of an HTML tag, using the style attribute. When CSS is written using the style attribute, it's called an "inline style". In general, this is not considered a best practice. However, there are times when inline styles are the right (or only) choice.</p>

	<p id="emb">Embedded style sheets refer to when you embed style sheet information into an HTML document using the style element. You do this by embedding the style sheet information within style tags in the head of your document.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p id="ext">An external style sheet is a separate file where you can declare all the styles that you want to use on your website. You then link to the external style sheet from all your HTML pages.

This means you only need to set the styles for each element once. If you want to update the style of your website, you only need to do it in one place.</p>
